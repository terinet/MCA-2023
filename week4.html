    <p>A pitch histogram is a graphical representation that illustrates the distribution of pitch or musical notes within a piece of music. 
    <br>In the context of music analysis, pitch refers to the perceived frequency of a sound, determining its musical note. </p>
    <p>X-Axis: Represents the different pitches or musical notes.
    <br>Y-Axis: Represents the frequency or occurrence of each pitch.</p>

<h2><b>Scatter plot of pitches</b></h2>
    <p>This plot explores the relationship between the duration of musical notes  and their corresponding pitches. 
    <br>This type of plot can provide insights into the rhythmic and pitch patterns within a musical composition.</p>
    <p>X-Axis: Represents the duration of each musical note, measured in quarter lengths and presented on a logarithmic scale.
    <br>Y-Axis: Represents the musical pitch of each note. Higher positions on the y-axis correspond to higher pitches, and lower positions correspond to lower pitches.
