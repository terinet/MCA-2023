    <h2><b>My theme</b></h2>
    <p>The theme for my dataset is Ludovico Einaudi's piece called Underwater 
<br>     Ludovico Einaudi is a renowned Italian pianist and composer known for his minimalist and emotionally evocative piano compositions. His music has gained widespread popularity and is featured in films and television.
<br> And today I will be analysing his song "Underwater" from the album "Underwater", which was released in 2022

    <h2><b>Challenges</b></h2>
    <h3><b>Working with music-related data</b></h3>
    <p>Access: Access to music-related data can be challenging due to copyright restrictions and licensing issues. </p>
    <p>Curation: Music data often comes in various formats, such as sheet music, audio recordings, and metadata. Curating these different types of data and ensuring their accuracy and completeness can be complex.<br></p> 

 <h3><b>Related to the theme</b></h3>
 <p>Ludovico Einaudi's music, like many contemporary compositions, may still be under copyright protection, making it hard to access and use for research purposes.</p>
 <p>Curating music data for Einaudi's work involves digitizing sheet music accurately, and collecting metadata about the piece, its performances, and its context.</p>
<p>Presently, data related to Ludovico Einaudi's piece "Underwater" can be found in various forms:
<br>- Musical Scores: Sheet music for "Underwater" may be available in printed or digital form, obtained through various sources like music publishers or archives.
<br>- Audio Recordings: Audio recordings of performances or Einaudi's own recordings of the piece can be found on streaming platforms, physical CDs, and in archives.
<br>- Metadata: Metadata related to the piece, such as composer information, performer details, recording dates, and album information, may be available on music databases, streaming platforms, or archival catalogs.</p>

 <p>To work with this theme effectively, I would need to navigate the copyright landscape, curate data from multiple sources, and ensure consistency in metadata for a comprehensive dataset on the topic.</p>
