        <h2>Differences between MusicXML and MEI</h2>
    <p>1) Metadata in MusicXML and MEI:
   <br>- MusicXML: Uses separate sections for metadata, such as title, composer, and instrumentation. The information is distributed across different elements, making it somewhat compartmentalized.
   <br>- MEI: Consolidates metadata in its `<meiHead>` element. This provides a more centralized approach, including more detailed sections and references for authorities. This results in a multi-level information display, which may appear more complex compared to MusicXML.

<br><br>2) Representation of Clef in MusicXML and MEI:
   <br>- MusicXML: Utilizes the `<clef>` tag to represent the clef element. Clef type and placement line are distinguished using the attributes `<sign>` and `<line>`.
  <br> - MEI: Also uses the `<clef>` tag for representing the clef element. However, MusicXML's distinction between clef type and placement line using `<sign>` and `<line>` attributes is not replicated in MEI.

<br><br>3) Representation of Key in MusicXML and MEI:
  <br> - MusicXML: Represents the key through a `<key>` element, which is placed within the 'attributes' parent element. The information is relatively straightforward.
   <br>- MEI: Represents the key through a more detailed `<keySig>` element. This element offers a broader array of child elements, providing a more extensive and nuanced representation of key information. Additionally, `<keySig>` can be associated with various attributes, contributing to a more flexible and comprehensive structure.</p>

  <h2>Challenges encountered</h2>
<p> I had some issues working with OMR software, particularly with incorrect time signatures, articulations, and note accuracy, as well as some information about my piece went missing (name, composer)
