The theme for my dataset is Ludovico Einaudi's piece called Underwater

Challenges of working with music-related data:
Access: Access to music-related data can be challenging due to copyright restrictions and licensing issues. 
Curation: Music data often comes in various formats, such as sheet music, audio recordings, and metadata. Curating these different types of data and ensuring their accuracy and completeness can be complex.

Challenges related to the theme:
Ludovico Einaudi's music, like many contemporary compositions, may still be under copyright protection, making it hard to access and use for research purposes.

Curating music data for Einaudi's work involves digitizing sheet music accurately, and collecting metadata about the piece, its performances, and its context.

Presently, data related to Ludovico Einaudi's piece "Underwater" can be found in various forms:
- Musical Scores: Sheet music for "Underwater" may be available in printed or digital form, obtained through various sources like music publishers or archives.
- Audio Recordings: Audio recordings of performances or Einaudi's own recordings of the piece can be found on streaming platforms, physical CDs, and in archives.
- Metadata: Metadata related to the piece, such as composer information, performer details, recording dates, and album information, may be available on music databases, streaming platforms, or archival catalogs.

To work with this theme effectively, I would need to navigate the copyright landscape, curate data from multiple sources, and ensure consistency in metadata for a comprehensive dataset on the topic.
