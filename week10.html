         <h2><b>Analysis</b></h2>
    <p>The transcribed version of the music is quite different from the original. <br>Even though both tracks are about the same length, the transcribed one is 3 seconds longer (29 seconds instead of the original 32 seconds). <br>The transcription keeps the original time signature but doesn't match the key of the original.

<br>A big challenge is finding the right notes. In the transcribed version, there are now 21 bars instead of the original 10, which means things got a bit mixed up.

<br>When I listen to both versions, I can catch a few parts that sound similar, but they're not happening consistently.</p>
